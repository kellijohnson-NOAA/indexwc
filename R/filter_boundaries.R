#' Determine which boundaries in a group should be eliminated
#'
#' @details Sometimes boundaries can be exactly equal and therefore do not need
#' to be included in a set. Other times a boundary was initially valid but
#' because there were no observations in the southern or northern limits the
#' truncated boundary makes the area become exactly equal to another boundary.
#' This can often be the case when there are no southern observations and a
#' boundary becomes equal to the coastwide boundary. Sometimes a northern
#' boundary is further south than the southern boundary, which essentially is a
#' negative area. The opposite can also happen. All of the above constitute bad
#' boundaries.
#'
#' Users often input perfectly fine boundaries but it is the truncation to only
#' positive tows, which is in effort to not predict to areas without
#' observations that leads to the boundary being bad.
#'
#' @param y A vector of y-axis coordinates, i.e., latitude. Coordinates should
#'   be in real values whether that is decimal degrees or m it does not matter
#'   but they cannot be character values.
#' @param boundaries TODO document
#' @return
#' A data frame with two columns (i.e., `upper` and `lower`) is returned,
#' where the bad areas are removed. If the input vectors are named, then the
#' resulting rows of the returned data frame will also be named.
